9. Random Quote Generator
Develop a random quote generator that displays a new inspiring quote each time the user clicks a button. Use JavaScript to store an array of quotes or draw them from an API and display them on the webpage.

Remember, the emphasis here is on learning and building a strong foundation in JavaScript. Start with smaller, viable projects and gradually increase the complexity as confidence and experience increase.
